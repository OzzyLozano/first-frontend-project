            I'm a student, I'm learning about web development, and currently I am on Frontend, but eventually I'd like to learn backend.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-1">
            So, my intention is for me to become a software and web developer, those two are my favourite part about programming. I really enjoy creating stuff out of scratch and that's why I'm into frontend that much.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-1">
            The reason I'm looking for a job is so that I can start growing, and of course creating various websites. I use and know html5, css3, bootstrap, javascript, react, and git & github; learned trough online courses, though I'm willing to learn specific frameworks and tools to work with in case needed, and keep learning the technologies I'll be needing to become a more useful worker or partner.
